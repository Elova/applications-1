description: "Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts, providing container-centric infrastructure. With Kubernetes, you are able to quickly and efficiently respond to customer demand:
* Deploy your applications quickly and predictably.
* Scale your applications on the fly.
* Seamlessly roll out new features.
* Optimize use of your hardware by using only the resources you need. Our goal is to foster an ecosystem of components and tools that relieve the burden of running applications in public and private clouds.
This stack allows you to deplay a multi-tenant multi-region HA Kubernetes cluster in few clicks."
