description: "OwnCloud is software to create and use a storage server online and file sharing. Your files are on a server that you control and hosted in France for Cloudwatt. Another interesting point to share your data with people you don't have to create a account. Feel free to share with or without password, ditto for authorizing or not the file repository."
