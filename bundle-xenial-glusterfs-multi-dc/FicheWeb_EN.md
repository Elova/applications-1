description: "GlusterFS is a powerful network/cluster filesystem written in user space which uses FUSE to hook itself with VFS layer. GlusterFS takes a layered approach to the file system, where features are added/removed as per the requirement. Though GlusterFS is a File System, it uses already tried and tested disk file systems like ext3, ext4, xfs, etc. to store the data. It can easily scale up to petabytes of storage which are available to user under a single mount point."
