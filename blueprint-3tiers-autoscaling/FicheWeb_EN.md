description: "This blueprint will help you to set up a 3-tier architecture. We have automated the deployment of various nodes component architecture. Through this blueprint we propose to set up web front-end, the glusterfs with a database cluster. You can choose to deploy on different Web front-end applications (Apache & php, tomcat 8 or nodejs). Thanks to its autoscaling capabilities, this blueprint can scale in or scale out accordingly to the load on an application."
