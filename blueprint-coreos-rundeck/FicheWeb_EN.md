description: "Rundeck is open source software that helps you automate routine operational procedures in data center or cloud environments. There are a lot of features that Rundeck offers, one of the ones I use is the ability to create jobs and workflows that allow me to execute commands on remote machines, capture the results, (success or failure) and then process that result and either continue on with the workflow or terminate it. I can have the system notify me via email or webhooks as well as many other options through the plugin system for notifications. In a nutshell, Rundeck is a feature rich tool to schedule and run your tasks on one or thousands of systems."
