description: "BackBee CMS is an open source Content Management System (CMS) with one major advantage. BackBee CMS uses On-page Editing Technology (OPE Technology) which means you can easily create and manage websites as they appear with no prior technical knowledge. On-page Editing Technology  is the natural evolution of your usual Content Management System functionalities. On-page Editing Technology is a tool that allows you to enter, edit and manage your website directly as it appears to your users: The back office and front office are merged. Today, Cloudwatt provides the necessary toolset to start your BackBee instance in a few minutes and to become its master. The deployement base is an CentOS 7 instance. The Apache and MariaDB servers are deployed on a single instance."
