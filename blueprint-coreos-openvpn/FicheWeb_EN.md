description: "OpenVPN is an open source tool allowing you to create your own VPN, in the aim to access to your instances without exposing them on Internet or to surf on Internet with a French IP address. Data inside OpenVPN's tunnel are encrypted thanks to a RSA keypair (public and private key). An advantage of OpenVPN is that you can use it on all your devices whether it be in a desktop environment or on a mobile phone."
