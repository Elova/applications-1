description: "pfSense is an open source firewall/router computer software distribution based on FreeBSD. It is installed on a physical computer or a virtual machine to make a dedicated firewall/router for a network and is noted for its reliability and offering features often only found in expensive commercial firewalls. It can be configured and upgraded through a web-based interface, and requires no knowledge of the underlying FreeBSD system to manage. PfSense is commonly deployed as a perimeter firewall, router, wireless access point, DHCP server, DNS server, and as a VPN endpoint. PfSense supports installation of third-party packages like Snort or Squid through its Package Manager. It ensures the security perimeter. This stack will deploy two instances: one is Pfsense application, the second for Pfsense administration is based on Ubuntu. "
